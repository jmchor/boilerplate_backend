The goal of this project is to provide the basic structure of a coding project in a manner of minutes. This includes the setting up of a basic folder structure, a framework, linting, the installation of dependencies and so on.
So, for example, if a User wants to start a new coding project, and decides for a React app written in TypeScript with a Node backend that uses Express and Postgres as its database, that is a manner of checking a few boxes and then downloading or copying a setup script written in bash.

After project set up, the app offers project maintenance and organization using a simple kanban board.

What the app offers as well is the building of a knowledge base - collecting articles and writing them, searching through a database of articles as well as grouping them for a project. This way, all the information for a project is in one place.

So, in the end you can use this app to set up and maintain your coding project. No more, no less.
