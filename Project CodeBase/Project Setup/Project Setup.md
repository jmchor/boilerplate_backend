Setting up the project itself (not the setup of all the project functions)

## Frontend setup
The frontend will be set up using [[Next.js and TypeScript]], as well as [[GraphQL Client (Apollo Client)]]. NextJS will be used solely for the page routing and not for server side rendering or React Server Components.

The folder structure will largely be informed by NextJS

## Backend setup
See: [[Folder Structure]] 
TODO: write [[folder structure script]] for automatic setup

The backend will be set up using NodeJS, Apollo GraphQL and MongoDB
